# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to detect whether a news article is real or fake. Built as part of the AICTE-Microsoft AI Azure Virtual Internship.

## 📌 Project Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed news dataset
- Used TF-IDF for vectorization
- Trained PassiveAggressiveClassifier model
- Accuracy: ~100% on mid-size data
- Predicts real vs. fake news using custom input
- Ready for deployment on web or cloud

## 🧪 Sample Prediction
Input: "New vaccine discovered to treat rare viruses"
Output: Fake News

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- nltk
- Google Colab

## 📁 Dataset
- Kaggle Fake and Real News Dataset
- Mid-size version used: 500 fake + 500 real

## 📈 Future Scope
- Upgrade to BERT / LSTM
- Build Streamlit/Flask frontend
- Host on Azure App Services

## 🎓 Built For
- AICTE-Microsoft AI Azure Virtual Internship by Edunet Foundation
